## Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between stock market movements and the sentiment of related news headlines. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to score the positivity or negativity of each headline, then aligns those scores with historical stock data to explore patterns and correlations. The notebook demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be applied to financial datasets to derive actionable insights.

## Features

- Collects and cleans stock news headline datasets
- Performs sentiment analysis on headlines
- Aggregates sentiment scores by company and date
- Visualizes sentiment trends and their relation to stock movements
- Compares multiple stocks for cross-sentiment evaluation
- Easily extendable for real-time analysis or API integration
